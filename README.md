  ## Installation
  
  Unimportant, but requires `npx create-react-app` for a very first tiem user starting from scratch. Also an `npm insall` to include all the basic goodies. Has dependency on bootstrap for visuals, and heavy react elements.

  ## Usage
  
  While being a host for six of my favorite projects to date, it is also an example of my progress as a developer within this course. All elements were built from the ground up, using React as the primary vehicle to display and handle information.
